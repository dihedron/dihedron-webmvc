	/**

	 * form submit starts being processed, the interceptors enters a synchronised 
	 * block that prevents other forms from being processed until the first one
	 * is done; then if a form has already been processed it is discarded and 
	 * the result is retrieved, so it can be re-rendered.
	 * This interceptor tries to be as lightweight as possible, but it severely
	 * interferes with the portal internal parallelism by removing concurrency of
	 * different portlets. Please consider adopting different mechanisms to prevent
	 * double-submit, such as disabling the submit button as soon as it is clicked.
	 * 
	 * @param invocation
	 *   the current action invocation.
	 * @return
	 *   the result of the nested components' execution if this form hasn't been 
	 *   submitted before, an error otherwise.
